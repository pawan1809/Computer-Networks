Question2: Create a scenario using packet tracer in which four different groups (CSE (10.1.0.0
Network Address), ME (10.2.0.0 Network Address) ECE (10.3.0.0 Network Address) and IP
(10.4.0.0 Network Address)) are created.
i. Group IP is using Extended start topology
ii. Group ECE uses Bus topology.
iii. Show the difference between hub, switch and bridge.
iv. Label the scenario properly.
Note: Minimum requirement is (2 Switches and 3 Hub). For experimental purpose each class
contain 4 end devices, IP address of these devices is allocated through given sub-netting.
